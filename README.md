# Hello World

**Hey there, you found the source code to my blog. That's cool.**

## Comments

GitHub is cool because it has a commenting system, so I used it to host my blog posts so you can [comment on them](https://github.com/acconrad/blog/tree/master/posts) if you see something you're interested in. 

## Hire me

See something you like? Want to know more? [Follow me on GitHub](https://github.com/acconrad) or send me an email at **acconrad [at] protonmail [dot] com**, I'd be happy to chat with you!
