You're in a meeting with your manager. They've got your performance review ready. You've got a mild amount of anxiety waiting for the results. She open's with:

> We'd love to promote you, but at this point you're going to have to make a move to management in order to keep growing here.

For some people that may seem like the worst thing in the world. "People management." The thought alone makes some people sick. For others, maybe not so extreme, but it certainly isn't the ideal role they saw for themselves. Let's focus on that camp: you know that in order for you to stay at your current employer and like your salary, you're probably going to have to suck it up and move into management. But how do you actually _do_ that? What is involved? What do you have to learn? How do I handle uncomfortable situations? I'm going to take a stab at a few of these enigmatic and possibly make a series out of it.

## Where do I start?

Let's say you've _just_ been promoted today. You now have people to manage and responsibilities like a team budget, and the ability to do things like hire and fire. Quick question: **are you sure?** That's right, step one is to **figure out exactly what is expected out of you**. Not every engineering manager will have a budget, or the ability to hire/fire. You should ask what your duties and responsibilities are; not only because it will help give you clarity, but also because _good managers set clear expectations for their directs_. So it's like you're getting management practice before you even leave the room from your promotion üëè.

Once you actually leave the room and you have to face the world, the next thing is to **set up weekly one-one-one meetings with all of the direct reports you've been assigned**. In a future post we'll go over exactly what goes into those meetings, how you schedule them, and why they are important, but trust me on this one, they are _extremely_ important (and I would argue the most important thing you will ever do as a manager).

Finally, before you leave for the day, you should have a quick huddle with your team and see if you can't find consensus on **setting up a weekly team huddle if you don't have one already**. In addition to working with your directs one-on-one, you'll also want to make sure everyone on your team is synced up with everyone else. Now if you are part of an Agile/Scrum team you probably have this kind of meeting set up already (they're usually called Retroes or Grooming meetings) so you can safely ignore this one, but if you don't, it's really important that everyone is on the same page as you tackle another week's worth of work.

If you haven't gotten the hint yet, **you start by making communication the cornerstone of your responsibilities**. Open, transparent communication is perhaps the best thing you can do from the start. Let people know where you're at, where the organization is at, and where you want your team to go. Setting clear expectations and open channels of communication from day one is a great way to make an excellent first impression when transitioning from individual contributor to manager.

## Okay, Day 1 is done. Now what?

You survived your first day as manager. You probably still got to write some code which made it not completely suck. But now you know the real work begins tomorrow. What to do in the interim? Well if you're like any other ambitious, hard-working developer, you probably want me to feed you some sort of reading list for how to start learning. Good thing I deliver what the people want.

* **The First 90 Days** (_Michael D. Watkins_) It's a Harvard Business School book with a click-baity subtitle, but it's actually pretty good. It's especially good because it actually has a checklist of things to do when you become a new manager, which is great. You could probably skim about 75% of this book because it attempts to prescribe solutions for all new managers, and not just ones like you who are brand new.
* **How to Win Friends and Influence People** (_Dale Carnegie_) This is not a management book. It's also a really trite recommendation that seems to be on everyone's list. So why am I recommending it? Because management is all about influence. You have to influence your directs to do the things you want (or need) them to do. You have to influence your manager to make things happen for your team. You have to find a way to deflect meetings off of your directs and keep them productive. And oh by the way, each one of those groups of people may not live/work/think the way you do. So how do you get on their level? Well, this book gives you a few tools to add to your set.
* **The 27 Challenges Managers Face** (_Bruce Tulgan_) Because The Law of Threes applies in everything from comedy to writing, and because it's a really good book, I'd say this one can round out your reading list for now. If there's one thing that freaks out most developers, it's dealing with people - _especially_ when they get emotional and/or illogical. So how are you supposed to deal with two people fighting over an architectural implementation? What if one of your coworkers-turned-directs flips out during a meeting? Or worse, what if one of your _friends_ is now your direct? How do you handle all of these situations and not look completely incompetent? This book, as it is so appropriately titled, will actually dive through the most common people challenges and how to solve them. And you know it's credible because they chose a number that isn't nice and round.

### Read those and get back to me

Between those three books that should definitely get you started on the right foot. If I had to distill it down to one book, I'd say the _First 90 Days_ given the appropriateness of your recent promotion, but truthfully it's more holistic than the other two, although _How to Win Friends_ is probably more universally applicable regardless of your profession. Honestly, I do think you should read all three, because each one covers a core facet of management that we'll dive into in future posts. At the end of the day, if you communicate regularly, delegate judiciously, and negotiate tactically, you're going to be fine. Feel free to leave a comment in the source code, and let me know what issues you run into. Happy managing!
